Questions

Given your previous design critiques, your experience with the previous graph visualization implementation and the reading of the article cited below (Lee et al., 2006), answer the following questions:

Which graph-related tasks does an ideal GitHub Network Graph need to address?

The relationships between various users. Especially showing key nodes and links in the graph.
It would be interesting to detect families and networks.

Get back to the GitHub network visualization you implemented and test it with the following projects on GitHub: D3, jQuery and Bootstrap. There's a lot more data, but the interaction patterns of users are also very different. What do you notice about the three repositories?

All three are from a single branch and sparse.

How does this impact your graph?

The graph is not presentable at all. There are too many nodes. 

How would you improve your visualization to address issues with the larger and more complex data?

I would show wisualisation by user or date or anyother relevant attribute.
